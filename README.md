# 📝 C Quiz Program

A simple interactive quiz program written in **C**.  
This project demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, and user input handling in C programming.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- 5 multiple-choice questions on general knowledge.
- Score calculation based on correct answers.
- Option to retake the quiz as many times as you want.
- Clean and beginner-friendly code structure.

---

## 📂 Code Overview
The program:
1. Asks the user 5 questions.
2. Uses `scanf` to take user input.
3. Increments the score for each correct answer.
4. Displays the final score after each attempt.
5. Asks if the user wants to retake the quiz (`1 = Yes`, `2 = No`).
6. Ends with a **Thank You** message.
